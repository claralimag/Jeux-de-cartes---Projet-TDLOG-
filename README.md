# Jeux-de-cartes---Projet-TDLOG-

Our goal is to code a game of Buraco. To do so we will procede wth the following steps :
1. Create the game structure : rules, how to represent each player, board. Allowing us to play in multiplayer mode. 
2. Create the graphics 
3. Implement a AI allowing single player mode (human vs machine)
4. Create differents game modes (open and closed game, number of players, team mode)
