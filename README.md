# Jeux-de-cartes---Projet-TDLOG-

Our goal is to code a game of Buraco. To do so we will procede wth the following steps :
1. Create the game structure : rules, how to represent each player, board. Allowing us to play in multiplayer mode. 
2. Create the graphics 
3. Implement a single player mode (human vs machine) that plays randomly (not quite)
4. Create differents game modes (open and closed game, number of players, team mode)
5. Implement a Artificial Inteligence 

First step : creating the game's structure 
1. Classes : Player, BoardPlayer, BoardGame, Cards
2. Main : functions -> create_game(), play_game()

Calendar : 
3/11 : first step is done - debugg + homework : (Emma thinks about cool colors (Pygame (maybe others?)), Implement a single player mode (Clara and Neil think about it during school break))

24/11 : we can play (maybe single player mode is not perfect, but playable) (All game modes but teams)

01/12 : we debugged everything and we solved team mode -> here we start thinking about IA or online playing in a website 

24/12 : we are showing our families what a great job we did
